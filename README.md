# Data Set

* initial dataset link:
    * * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births
* follow-on dataset pulled from:
    * * https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality.html

* Only factors associated with an individual live birth events


* Births were grouped by multiple factors (i.e., State,  Mother’s Age , Birth Weight)

* Data covered a timeline from 2007 to 2021

* Limitations: data doesn’t track family size or individual family growth over time
* * A mother could show up in multiple categories (i.e., Education Level,  Mother’s Age at Birth) as time progresses

# Initial Questions

* Are birth rates declining in the US?

* What is the standard range of birth weights in the US today?

* Is there a correlation between education level or age of mother to a change in birth rate?

# Findings
* Total births in the US are declining year over year:

* One interesting find in this data was a sharp increase in the overall births correlating with the Covid-19 Pandemic.  It is possible that this surge in births is due to the lockdowns and partners spending more time together with little to do.

* When we look at the same data separated by marital status, we can see the uptick is entirely represented by women in a marriage.
* Births to unmarried women and those who didn't report marital status (California stoped recording marital status for all births beginning in 2017) no longer continued declining (as had been the trend since 2019) and instead leveled out.

* The average birth weights in the US changes depending on the mother's age at the time of birth and ranges anywhere from 6.7lbs for a 23year old mother to 7.5lbs for a 35 year old mother.
